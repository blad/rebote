# Rebote

_Rebote_ is a simple that checks whether an error is one of the standard 
Javascript errors and rethrows it. _Rebote_ is the spanish word for 
[_bounce_](#inspiration).

Example usage:

```javascript
import rebote from "rebote";

try {
  const response = await someAsyncFunction();
} catch (e) {
  // This line rethrows any of the standard JS errors
  // which are otherwise silenced due to the try catch.
  rebote.rethrow(e);
}
```

The standard Javascript errors rethrown are:

- EvalError
- RangeError
- ReferenceError
- SyntaxError
- TypeError
- URIError

## API

### rebote.rethrow(error, type)
- `error` is the cought error that should be checked and potentially rethrown.
- `type` is any of `native`, `any`, `all`. Default: `native`.
  - `native` - rethrows only the standard JS errors listed above.
  - `any`, `all` - rethrow all errors regardless of type.

## Inspiration

This library was inspired by [bouce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bounce). However, 
`bounce` has additional dependencies on [hoek](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hoek) 
and [boom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boom) which are related to node's 
[hapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hapi) which may contain code mean for node and 
not the browser.

Rebote aims to be free of platform specific dependencies and usable in both node and 
javascript in the the browser (after being bundled.)
